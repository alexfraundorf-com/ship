System Requirements:

PHP 5.3 or later
SoapClient (for UPS plugin) - should be included in your PHP distribution by default

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPS notes:

In order to use this software you will need several things from UPS (United Parcel Service).
1. A valid UPS shipper number.
2. An online account at www.ups.com (you will need a valid shipper number first).  Make sure you choose a username 
and password you are comfortable keeping for a while.  You will need to use both with every API call.
3. Sign up for API access at www.ups.com/upsdeveloperkit.
Once approved, you will receive an API key that you will need to use for every API call.  Note: At 
the time of this writing, there is a known issue with this section of UPS's site and Chrome will return 
a blank page.  You will need to use a different browser.

Once you have obtained these items, enter them in the includes/config.php file.
